# BCM2837B0

Used on the Raspberry Pi 3B+ and 3A+.

The underlying architecture of the BCM2837B0 is identical to the previous revision of the BCM2837. The only significant difference is the improved cooling, including metal heat spreader, which permits a higher clock speed. By contrast, BCM2835, BCM2836 and revision A0 of the BCM2837 use black plastic packages.
