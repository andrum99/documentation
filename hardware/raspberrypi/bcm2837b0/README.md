# BCM2837B0

Used on the Raspberry Pi 3B+ and 3A+.

The underlying architecture of the BCM2837B0 is identical to the BCM2837A0 chip used in other versions of the Pi. The ARM core hardware is the same: the only significant difference is the higher clock speed which is possible due to enhanced cooling.

The metal heat spreader on the top of this SoC makes it easy to distinguish from the previous revision, which used a black plastic package.
